MODIJI CRAWLER: I navigated to Modi's wikipedia page, got all the links on that page and stored them in a blank list called links. Then, for each link in links, I created a new driver object, went to that link in order to navigate it and then stored all the links on the page of the new link in a list called lnks. After that, I cleared the lnks list for next iteration and also closed the driver object.

E-LAFDA: I logged in to twitter using Selenium, went to Elon Musk's twitter page and got n tweets from there.

CERVICAL CANCER: I developed a predictive model for detecting cervical cancer. Data imbalance was addressed using SMOTE for oversampling. The Random Forest model, trained on oversampled data, emerged as the best predictor, outperforming Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
