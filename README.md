# SUMARIZZING--ASSIGNMENT1
#TASK-3 MODIJI CRAWLER DONE (UPTO 2 LEVELS) #TASK-2 E-LAFDA DONE 
#In task3, I basically navigated to Modi's wikipedia page, got all the links on that page and stored them in a blank list called links. Then, for each link in links, I created a new driver object, went to that link in order to navigate it and then stored all the links on the page of the new link in a list called lnks. After that, I cleared the lnks list for next iteration and also closed the driver object.
#In task2, I logged in to twitter using Selenium, went to Elon Musk's twitter page and got n tweets from there.
